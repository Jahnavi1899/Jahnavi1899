## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Jahnavi, a recent Computer Science grad from North Carolina State University, passionate about building large-scale software solutions powered by AI. I love diving into new technologies and bringing my ideas to life through hands-on projects. Right now, I’m exploring the worlds of distributed systems and large language models, while also leveling up my skills with the Google Cloud Engineering certification.

When I’m not in code mode, you’ll probably find me watching movies, jamming out to music, or out on the field playing sports. I believe mixing curiosity for tech with everyday adventures keeps life exciting and fuels my creative spark—there’s always something new to learn, inside and outside the world of software!
